Description:
We have n chips, where the position of the ith chip is position[i].

We need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, we can change the position of the ith chip from position[i] to:

position[i] + 2 or position[i] - 2 with cost = 0.
position[i] + 1 or position[i] - 1 with cost = 1.
Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.

 

Example 1:


Input: position = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1 with cost = 0.
Second step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.
Total cost is 1.
Example 2:


Input: position = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can move the two chips at position  3 to position 2. Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.
Example 3:

Input: position = [1,1000000000]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= position.length <= 100
1 <= position[i] <= 10^9

Solution:
class Solution:
    def minCostToMoveChips(self, position: List[int]) -> int:
        if sum(1 for i in position if i%2==0)>=sum(1 for i in position if i%2==1):
            x=min(i for i in position if i%2==0)
        else:
            x=min(i for i in position if i%2==1)
        position=sorted(position, key=position.count, reverse=True)
        ans=[0 if (abs(i-x))%2==0 else 1 for i in position]
        return sum(ans)
