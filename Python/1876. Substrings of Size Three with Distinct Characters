Description:
A string is good if there are no repeated characters.

Given a string s, return the number of good substrings of length three in s.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "xyzzaz"
Output: 1
Explanation: There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 
The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".
Example 2:

Input: s = "aababcabc"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
The good substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of lowercase English letters.

Solution:
substrings=[s[i:i+3] for i in range(len(s)-2)]
        substrings=[n for n in substrings if sorted(list(n))==sorted(list(set(n)))]
        return len(substrings)
