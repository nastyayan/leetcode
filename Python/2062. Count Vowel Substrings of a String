Description:
A substring is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

A vowel substring is a substring that only consists of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') and has all five vowels present in it.

Given a string word, return the number of vowel substrings in word.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "aeiouu"
Output: 2
Explanation: The vowel substrings of word are as follows (underlined):
- "aeiouu"
- "aeiouu"
Example 2:

Input: word = "unicornarihan"
Output: 0
Explanation: Not all 5 vowels are present, so there are no vowel substrings.
Example 3:

Input: word = "cuaieuouac"
Output: 7
Explanation: The vowel substrings of word are as follows (underlined):
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
- "cuaieuouac"
 

Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 100
word consists of lowercase English letters only.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def countVowelSubstrings(self, word: str) -> int:
        count=0
        if len(word)<5:
            return count
        else:
            for i in range(len(word)-4):
                for j in range(i+5,len(word)+1):
                    if set(word[i:j])==set('aeiou'):
                        count+=1
            return count
