Description:

You are given a 0-indexed string s consisting of only lowercase English letters, where each letter in s appears exactly twice. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array distance of length 26.

Each letter in the alphabet is numbered from 0 to 25 (i.e. 'a' -> 0, 'b' -> 1, 'c' -> 2, ... , 'z' -> 25).

In a well-spaced string, the number of letters between the two occurrences of the ith letter is distance[i]. If the ith letter does not appear in s, then distance[i] can be ignored.

Return true if s is a well-spaced string, otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abaccb", distance = [1,3,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 2 so it satisfies distance[0] = 1.
- 'b' appears at indices 1 and 5 so it satisfies distance[1] = 3.
- 'c' appears at indices 3 and 4 so it satisfies distance[2] = 0.
Note that distance[3] = 5, but since 'd' does not appear in s, it can be ignored.
Return true because s is a well-spaced string.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aa", distance = [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Output: false
Explanation:
- 'a' appears at indices 0 and 1 so there are zero letters between them.
Because distance[0] = 1, s is not a well-spaced string.
 

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 52
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
Each letter appears in s exactly twice.
distance.length == 26
0 <= distance[i] <= 50

Solution:

    def checkDistances(self, s: str, distance: List[int]) -> bool:
        s=list(s)
        alphabet=list(string.ascii_lowercase)
        dictionary = dict(zip(alphabet,distance))
        letters=[key for (key,value) in dictionary.items() if value!=0 and key in s or value==0 and key in s]
        positions=[value for (key,value) in dictionary.items() if value!=0 and key in s or value==0 and key in s]
        ans=[]
        for i in range(len(letters)):
            count=0
            for j in range(s.index(letters[i][0])+1,len(s)):
                if s[j]!=letters[i][0]:
                    count+=1
                else:
                    ans.append(count)
                    break
        return ans==positions
