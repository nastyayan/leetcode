Description:

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100

Solution:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        count=0
        head1=deepcopy(head)
        while head1:
            count+=1
            head1=head1.next
        count=int(count/2)
        while count>0:
            head = head.next
            count-=1
        return head
